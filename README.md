Single player implementation of the card game Set for iOS using SwiftUI and MVVM development paradigm.

<p>Players identify sets of three cards based on attributes like color, shape, number, and shading. A valid set consists of three cards where each attribute is either all the same or all different across the cards. For example, if all three cards have the same color but different shapes, or if each card has a different number, they form a valid set. The app provides a grid of cards, allowing players to select and find these valid sets. Developed using Swift and UIKit, it includes basic game functionality and scoring.</p>
