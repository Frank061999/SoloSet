Single player implementation of the card game Set for iOS using SwiftUI and MVVM development paradigm.

Known issues: 
When resetting the game, the intention is for the cards to disappear with animation and for new cards to reappear with animation. This does not work as expected. Perhaps implementing a delay betwen removal and insertion will fix this problem.
